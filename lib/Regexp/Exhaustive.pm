=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module does an exhaustive match of a pattern against a string. That means that it will match all ways possible, including all backtracked and overlapping matches.

It works a lot like the familiar C<m//g> regarding return values.

Beware that exhaustive matching may generate a very large number of matches. If you only need overlapping matches that's easily achieved. Overlapping matching has a maximum number of matches being the length of the string plus one.

This is an initial release, and many things may change for the next version. If you feel something is missing or poorly designed, now is the time to voice your opinion.


=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

Nothing is exported by default. The C<:ALL> tag exports everything that can be exported.

=over

=item exhaustive(STRING => qr/PATTERN/)

Exhaustively generates and returns all matches in list context. Returns the number of matches in scalar context.

If the pattern doesn't contain any capturing subpatterns, the matched string (equivalent of C<$&>) is returned. If only one capturing subpattern is seen then C<$1> is returned. Otherwise C<$1>, C<$2>, etc is returned grouped using array references.

This is like C<m//g> in list context, except C<m//g> returns all capturing subpatterns as a flat list.

This method does not interact with C<pos($str)> and can be safely intermixed with other match operations against the string.

Worthy to note is that it's much more efficient to use C<qr/(.)/> than C<qr/./>, i.e. making direct use of C<$1> instead of having C<&exhaustive> calculate C<$&>.

=item exhaustive(STRING => qr/PATTERN/, qw[ $1 $2 @- $^R ... ])

Optionally, you can specify which variables to return. Arrays and hashes will end up as references in the return list.

If two or more variables are specified they will be grouped using array references.

    my @matches = exhaustive('abc' => qr/(a)|(b)/, qw/ $1 $2 $+ /);

    for (@matches) {
        print join("\t", map { defined() ? $_ : 'undef' } @$_) . "\n";
    }

    __END__
    a       undef   a
    undef   b       b

Supported variables:

    Punctuation:    English alias:
    $<*digits*>
    $`              $PREMATCH
    $&              $MATCH
    $'              $POSTMATCH
    $+              $LAST_PAREN_MATCH
    $^N
    @+              @LAST_MATCH_END
    @-              @LAST_MATCH_START
    %-
    %+
    $^R             $LAST_REGEXP_CODE_RESULT

Using C<$`>, C<$&>, and C<$'> with C<&exhaustive> doesn't impose the performance penalty that those variables otherwise impose. However, they're usually slower to use than rewriting the pattern to use capturing subpatterns. In particular, C<$&> is often easy to avoid by just adding an outer capturing parenthesis and using C<$1> instead.

=item overlapping(STRING => qr/PATTERN/)

If this function would exist, but it doesn't, it would be like global match but try to match from every position of the string. It's like an exhaustive match that doesn't backtrack inside the pattern.

This function doesn't exist because it isn't needed. Instead use

    exhaustive(STRING => qr/(?>PATTERN)/)

i.e. wrap the pattern with the C<< (?>...) >> assertion. This will lock the match once the pattern has matched, forcing the regex engine to skip behind the pattern when backtracking, thus moving forward on string for the next match.

Using

    STRING =~ /(?=PATTERN)/g

will be faster, but has three key differences: (1) assumes C<pos()> is undefined, (2) undefines C<pos()>, and (3) returns all captured subpatterns as a flat list. Note that saving away C<pos()> and then restoring it may cause certain global matches to loop infinitely.

    $_ = 'foo';

    while (/.??/g) {
        print pos();
        pos() = pos(); # Not really doing anything, or is it?
    }

This will loop forever.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Use of uninitialized value in &Regexp::Exhaustive::exhaustive

(W|uninitialized) The string given to &exhaustive was not defined.

=item The second argument to &Regexp::Exhaustive::exhaustive must be a Regexp object (qr//)

(F) Self-explanatory.

=item Uninitialized value passed to &Regexp::Exhaustive::exhaustive as variable name

(F) An argument for a regex variable name was not defined.

=item Bad variable name(s) to &Regexp::Exhaustive::exhaustive: %s

(F) You supplied a string that didn't look like a known regex variable. See C<&exhaustive> for supported variables.

=head1 EXAMPLES

See L</"SYNOPSIS"> for more examples.

=head2 Finding all divisors

A commonly known snippet of regex can be used to find out if an integer is a prime number or not.

    sub is_prime {
        my ($n) = @_;

        my $str = '.' x $n;

        return $str =~ /^(?:..+)\1+$/ ? 0 : 1;
    }

    print '9 is prime: ', is_prime(9), "\n";
    print '11 is prime: ', is_prime(11), "\n";

    __END__
    9 is prime: 0
    11 is prime: 1

Equally simple is it, with C<Regexp::Exhaustive>, to find out not only if it's a prime number, but which its divisors are.

    use Regexp::Exhaustive 'exhaustive';

    sub divisors {
        my ($i) = @_;

        return map length, exhaustive('.' x $i => qr/^(.+?)\1*$/);
    }

    print "$_\n" for divisors(12);

    __END__
    1
    2
    3
    4
    6
    12

=head2 Finding the cross product

L<Set::CrossProduct|Set::CrossProduct> gives you the cross product of a set, and that's the good way of doing just that. But as an example, here's how you can find all possible combinations of two four-sided dice using C<Regexp::Exhaustive>. To illustrate the difference between greedy and non-greedy matches I let the second die be in reversed order.

    use Regexp::Exhaustive 'exhaustive';

    my $sides = '1234';
    my @sets = exhaustive(
        "$sides\n$sides"
        =>
        qr/^.*?(.).*\n.*(.)/
    );

    print "@$_\n" for @sets;

    __END__
    1 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 1
    2 4
    2 3
    2 2
    2 1
    3 4
    3 3
    3 2
    3 1
    4 4
    4 3
    4 2
    4 1

=head2 N-ary count

Using C<Regexp::Exhaustive> you can generate all values of a certain digit length using an n-ary count. This is demonstrated for binary numbers with a length of three.

    use Regexp::Exhaustive 'exhaustive';

    sub all_values {
        my ($n, @base) = @_;
        my $str = (join('', @base) . "\n") x $n;
        my $re = ".*?(.).*\n" x $n;
        return map { join '', @$_ } exhaustive($str, qr/^$re/);
    }

    print "$_\n" for all_values(3, qw/ 0 1 /);

    __END__
    000
    001
    010
    011
    100
    101
    110
    111


=head1 WARNING

This module uses the experimental C<(?{ ... })> assertion. Thus this module is as experimental as that assertion.
